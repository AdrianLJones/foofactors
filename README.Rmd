This is a practice package for [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io).

This is just the demo Jenny is posting for students to consult / start with for their homework.
Adrian Jones forked the package and added the function factor_mush, a function that combines certain factor levels into one level.  

Here's how to use the `foofactors` package.


```{r}
#install_github("STAT545/foofactors")
library(foofactors)
fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])
freq_out(iris$Species)

#Here is factor_mush in use
test <- as.factor(c("a", "b", "c","c", "b", "a", "a1", "b1", "c1"))
factor_mush(test, c("a", "c"), "ac")
```
